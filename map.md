# What does the Index result in ? 

Here, we display the optimised weights and the Greater London Area maps that result from the optimised ALDI ranking. 

The optimised weights:

The ward-level map :

The borough-level map:

# Discussion on food 

# Want to play around with the weights  ?

We provide sliders for you to customize your index ! You can choose what categories are important to you and attribute them larger weights, and see how the boroughs evolve !
