# An Overview of some Important Categories

Let's take a look at a few indicators to understand what is in them and understand what we are measuring !

## Foods 

here we want to insert a few graphs of foods:

We notice that this indicator contains a diverse distribution of food categories. 

## Environment

## Safety

## Sounds easy right ? But ... 

This was a brief overview of what is contained in our subcategories. This data is actually rescaled and normalized in order to compare the different values on the same scale. Evidently, we cannot compare the pollution emitted via particle counts to a count of violent incidents happening ! 

Once we rescale all our data we obtain independent indicators, as showcased here in this heatmap :

< inlcude heatmap of all indicators> 

As you can observe by the colors, all our indicators are independent of one another, which is an essential criterion for producing an index that reflects different aspects of life evaluation. 

After that, we looked to optimize the weights attributed to each category. That is, we employed Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the directions that contain the most variance, and assigning them more important weights. This process allows us to **optimize** the weights. In the end, we obtain an index containing the weights of each indicators such that they optimally represent the data we have and reflect most accurately what is going on in the Greater London Area.
