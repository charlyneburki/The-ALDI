## How do you know the Index actually reflects life quality ?

We don't! This index is only an indicator based on a couple of factor. But one might think that income is the sole factor in life quality, thus  our index is quite irrelevant. In the end it is a subjective question, and it definitevely makes more sense to apply these kind of indexes when comparing countries developpement levels. However if you ever decide to move to london it might help you choose an area. It's also a nice tool to see how indicators influence, or don't influence each other.    

### But does it mean something ? 

While  the web for datasets, we stumbled upon an excel file made by the Greater London Authority that measured well-being based on happiness, worthwhile, life satisfaction and anxiety. This is the same data used for [this map](https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/this-map-shows-londons-happiest-and-saddest-boroughs-100516). We looked at how our index correlates with these subjective wellbeing questions asked to people all over London. In the following heatmap, we can see our final index, computed with two different normalisation methods:

## So ... 

We have here an index that predicts life quality of different areas, based on a number of factors, it correlates quite well with happiness, worthwhile and life satisfactoin, and doesn't with anxiety (great even if we would prefer to see negative correlation here). It is better than self reported factors (although we include some to), as it takes into account more objective life developpement indicators. 

Thanks for staying with us till the end.
