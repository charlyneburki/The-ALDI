# How do you know the Index actually reflects what you claim ?

It's hard to evaluate this, even for experts ! However, we provide a few explanations as to why, at least, the process we developped is valid. 

## Using validation data

While we explored the web for datasets, we stumbled upon an excel file made by the Greater London Authority that measured well-being indicators based on 12 different basic measures. We < explain briefly what we did to compare the validation >. Therefore, we obtain similar results, meaning at least that there is evidence that the Index we developped yields measurements comparable to a different technique employed. Furthermore, qualitatively speaking, we found a map that shows the happiness (subjective?) of the different boroughs. If we compare the resulting map we obtained from our optimisation, generally speaking we can observe similar trends (they are however not perfect). 

## So ... 

To ascertain that the Index we developped actually reflects life
